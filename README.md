# Template Creation for Higgs Combine

This repository holds a class that is designed to create templates for Higgs Combine. It will generate the histograms for Combine, as well as the datacards required for both a 1-dimensional fit using $\text{m}_{4\mu}$, and a 2-dimensional fit using both $\text{m}_{4\mu}$ and an optimal observable discriminant (ex: $D_{0-}$).
